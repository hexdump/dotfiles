# moom-config

I have to install Moom from the App Store since I purchased it there.

# `Moom > Preferences > Mouse`

I have no idea why there's a delay by default; it's super frustrating. Set `Delay` to `None` with the slider.

# `Moom > Preferences > Keyboard`

I've bound Moom to `Command-G`, which seems to be a reasonable option for not interfering with other application keybinds.

# `Moom > Custom`

Increase `Define window sizes using` to `25` x `25`, the max size.

My custom presets are binary splits with a 1 cell border:

![Preset 1 is the whole screen with a 1 cell border. Preset 2 is the left half of the screen with a 1 cell border (25x11). Preset 3 is the right half of the screen with a 1 cell border (25x11).](images/sizes-1.png)

![Preset 4 is the top left corner of the screen with a 1 cell border (11x11). Preset 5 is the lower left corner, 6 is the upper right, and 7 is the bottom right.](images/sizes-2.png)
