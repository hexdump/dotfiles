# Installation

Skip setup; we won't use any of the configuration options in it.
If it prompts you to access contacts, accessibility, or full disk access, deny these permissions; we'll only be using it as an application launcher. Do allow notifications.

# Swap Spotlight keybind to Alfred

In `System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Spotlight`, disable the default `Show Spotlight search` keybinding.
In Alfred, rebind this to the Alfred hotkey.

# Alfred Configuration

In `Features`, disable all the `Default Results` except for applications. Disable all options in `Web Search` and `Dictionary`.
In `Appearance`, in the lower left `Options` menu, check `Hide hat on Alfred window`, `Hide result shortcuts`, and `Hide menu bar icon`.
