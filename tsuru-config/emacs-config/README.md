# emacs-config

`init.el` is my `emacs` init file. `lib` is my el package files. Both should be placed in `~/.emacs.d`.

# get clipboard working

you'll need the `xclip` package to share the emacs clipboard with the rest of the system's clipboard. in arch-based distributions, `xclip` may be installed through `pacman`:

```bash
$ sudo pacman -S xclip
```
