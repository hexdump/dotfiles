# Firefox/Tor Browser Configuration

## Preferences

### General

Enable `When you open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately`. Disable the default browser check. Set the downloads path to a downloads folder in your home folder.

### Home

I've removed everything under the Home section of preferences, setting the homepage/new tab window to `Blank Page`, and removing all of the `Firefox Home Content`.

### Search

Under Search, I've enabled search suggestions but disabled all one-click search engines besides DuckDuckGo.

### Privacy and Security

I've disabled Tor Browser's `Always use private browsing mode`.

## Navbar Configuration

Here's my navigation bar configuration:
