# earbuds-config

This is the configuration for my Klipsch T5 II earbuds, codenamed `omari` (a reference to "Through The Wire").

## Reset Earbuds

Take the earbuds out of the case, and hold down the buttons on both of them. They'll both beep, and a couple seconds later (while you're still holding down the buttons), it'll tell you the headphones are reset. Place them back in the case.

While they're in the case, we will also synchronize them. Press the button on the left earbud 5 times, making sure it pulses red after you're done. Do the same for the right earbud. They will both pulse red for a little bit, and then turn purple once they're connected (this is the only time the earbuds will glow purple). Close the case.

## Klipsch Connect

I reluctantantly use the Klipsch Connect app. I use it only to set the transparency level to maximum, and to occasionally check battery status or install firmware updates.

It'll prompt you to be able to access your device's location. LineageOS will conveniently only allow you to select "while using the app". I hypothesize that location services is used for something relating to bluetooth connectivity. I hope.

- Take the earbuds out of the case and place them in your ears to pair.

- Reluctantly provide personal information for "registration".

- Name the headpones `omari` in the Klipsch Connect app.

- When you're prompted by the system to pair with the headphones, allow the connection.
  - Don't allow access to contacts and call history.

- In `Settings > Transparency Mode` in the Klipsch Connect app, enable Transparency Mode, and increase the Default Transparency Setting to High. Disable Transparency Mode again. Transparency mode can be toggled by a short press of the button on the left earbud.

- Take the earbuds out of the case.

- Rename the headphones in LineageOS's Bluetooth settings to `omari`.
