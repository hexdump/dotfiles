# dotfiles

My personal collection of computer configuration guides both for
personal reference and reproducibility as well as allowing other
people to use my utilities.

## Repository Structure

Each system that I've customized is documented in a folder ending in
`-config` in this repository. Each has a `README.md` which tells you
the configuration steps I took; pertinent dotfiles will also be in
those directories.

When the installation has multiple levels of specificity (e.g., 
setting up bash completions on macOS), there will be `*-config` folders
inside `*-config` folders.
